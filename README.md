Fraud Detection Model
- Project Overview
  This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to proactively detect fraudulent financial transactions. The goal is to build an effective and robust system that can identify patterns indicative of fraud within a large transactional dataset, providing an actionable tool for a financial company to prevent financial losses and protect its customers.

- Key Features and Techniques
 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, including outlier treatment through capping to preserve valuable data points, which are often indicative of fraudulent behavior.

 - Feature Engineering: New, highly predictive features were engineered from existing data, such as balanceDiffOrig and balanceDiffDest, to highlight anomalies in account balances.

 - Handling Imbalanced Data: The dataset had a severe class imbalance (less than 1% fraud). This was addressed using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method to balance the training data, enabling the model to learn from the minority class.

 - Model Selection: An XGBoost Classifier was chosen for its strong performance and robustness, particularly for imbalanced datasets.

 - Model Fine-Tuning: The model's decision threshold was fine-tuned to balance the trade-off between Precision (minimizing false alarms) and Recall (catching all fraud), resulting in a practical and effective solution.

- Performance and Results
 - The final model was rigorously evaluated using a set of metrics suitable for imbalanced classification problems. The key performance indicators were:

 - Recall: The model achieved a high recall score, indicating its ability to successfully identify the majority of fraudulent transactions.

 - Precision: The precision score was significantly improved through fine-tuning, demonstrating the model's reduced number of false positives.

 - F1-Score: A high F1-score was achieved, reflecting a strong and practical balance between precision and recall, which is essential for a real-world fraud detection system.

- Technical Stack
 - Python: The primary programming language.

 - Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

 - Scikit-learn: For data splitting, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

 - XGBoost: The core machine learning algorithm.

 - Imbalanced-learn: To handle the imbalanced dataset.

 - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting model performance.
